/// This file contains `MediaApiClientInterface`. It is designed to
/// utilize the
/// [PeerConnection](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#peer-to-peer-connections)
/// interface.
///
/// It demonstrates "how-to", and establishes the required configurations and
/// SCTP/SRTP connections with Meet servers. These connections enable the
/// streaming of conference metadata, video, and audio streams from Google Meet
/// conferences to the client.
///
/// @note This is a reference client. It is not intended to be a complete SDK
/// with full support, customization, nor optimizations of WebRTC and real time
/// communication.
///
/// All conference media streams are "receive-only". Currently, the Meet Media
/// API does not support sending of media from `MediaApiClientInterface` into a
/// conference.
///
/// API requests from the client intended to affect application state of a
/// conference or received media (e.g. change video resolution), are transmitted
/// via SCTP data channels. This is in contrast to typical API requests over
/// HTTP or RPC.
///
/// The following steps are needed to set up a typical Meet Media API session:
///
/// 1. Create an implementation of the `MediaApiClientObserverInterface`.
///
/// 2. Create a `MediaApiClientInterface` using an implementation of the
/// `MediaApiClientFactoryInterface`.
///
/// 3. Call `MediaApiClientInterface::ConnectActiveConference` with the
/// appropriate parameters. This initiates the connection with Meet servers.
///
/// 4. Wait for the `MediaApiClientObserverInterface::OnJoined` callback to be
/// invoked.
///
/// 5. If video was enabled, send a `meet::SetVideoAssignmentRequest` via
/// `MediaApiClientInterface::SendRequest`. No video will be
/// transmitted from Meet servers to the client until a successful request has
/// been sent. Check `video_assignment_resource.h` for more information.
